# Fraction_Holder

This project creates a C++ Fraction class designed to hold fractions. For example 1 / 10 would be stored as two values, 1 and 10, not 0.1. Each fraction is stored in its lowest common terms. Mathematical operations are performed on the fractions by overloading operators.  The user is also able to input multiple fractions and sum them together.
